# Welcome!

In this workshop, we'll work through a real ecological dataset from start to finish — importing raw government data, cleaning it into a tidy format, and building a visualization — all using the **Tidyverse**.

Before we start, let's quickly review some of the R basics. 

# R Overview

### R layout

Your R environment consists of four different panes: 

- **Source:** The pane that we are currently reading this text in! This is where you can view and edit various code-related files. 
- **Console:** Where you can interactively execute code and access the terminal.
- **Environment:** Displays current R/Python objects from your current working session.
- **Output:** Displays various outputs such as plots, HTML content, or on-disk files. It contains the Files, Plots, R Packages, Help, Tutorial, Viewer, and Presentation tabs.

### Creating a code chunk 
You can use the following keyboard shortcut to create a code chunk: 

- **Mac:** `Command + Option + I`
- **PC:** `Ctrl + Alt + I`

You can also manually add a code chunk the with green box with a C in it, at the top of your source pane!

Outside code chunks, you can include markdown text, just like this! 



### Running Code 
To execute your code, you can use either a keyboard shortcut, the Run button at the top of the source pane, or the play button at the top of an individual code chunk. 

- **Mac:** `Option + Return`
- **PC:** `Ctrl + Enter`




# Data Overview

This dataset comes from the [USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS)](https://www.nass.usda.gov/), which surveys beekeepers across the U.S. to track colony health. It records the percentage of honeybee colonies affected by various stressors — such as Varroa mites, diseases, and pesticides — broken down by state and quarter.

The dataset was intentionally "messified" for teaching purposes, introducing common real-world issues like inconsistent capitalization, USDA placeholder codes, and wide-format layout.

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `State` | U.S. state name (inconsistently cased) |
| `Quarter` | Survey quarter (e.g., `Q1_2024`) |
| `Period` | Text description of the quarter |
| `Varroa mites (%)` | % of colonies affected by Varroa mites |
| `Other pests/parasites (%)` | % affected by other pests or parasites |
| `Diseases (%)` | % affected by diseases |
| `Pesticides (%)` | % affected by pesticides |
| `Other (%)` | % affected by other causes |
| `Unknown (%)` | % affected by unknown causes |


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
stressors_messy <- 
```
Now let's see what our messy data looks like:

```{r}


```

```{r}


```


# Data Cleaning 

Data cleaning is where you'll spend most of your time in any real analysis. The good news: the Tidyverse makes it readable and even enjoyable with the **pipe operator** `|>`.

## The Pipe: Your New Best Friend

The pipe (`|>`) takes the output of one function and feeds it as the first argument to the next function. It lets us chain transformations that read like a recipe:

```{r}

# Without the pipe (nested, hard to read):
head(sort(unique(stressors_messy$State)))

# With the pipe (step by step, easy to read):
stressors_messy$State |>
  unique() |>
  sort() |>
  head()
```

Both produce the same result, but the piped version reads top-to-bottom — just like a set of instructions.


## Step 1: Rename Columns

Our column names have spaces and parentheses. In R, that means we have to wrap them in backticks every time we reference them — annoying and error-prone. Let's give them clean, short, `snake_case` names with `rename()`:


```{r}

  rename(
    state        = State,
    quarter      = Quarter,
    period       = Period,
    varroa_mites = `Varroa mites (%)`,
    other_pests  = `Other pests/parasites (%)`,
    diseases     = `Diseases (%)`,
    pesticides   = `Pesticides (%)`,
    other        = `Other (%)`,
    unknown      = `Unknown (%)`
  ) |>
```

## Step 2: Fix Inconsistent State Names

Some state names are ALL CAPS, some are lowercase.

```{r}

```

We can see entries like `"CALIFORNIA"`, `"michigan"`, and `"TEXAS"` — all referring to states that should have consistent Title Case names. We'll use `mutate()` to modify a column and `str_to_title()` to convert our strings to title case. 

```{r}

```


## Step 3: Replace Codes and Convert to Numbers


The USDA uses `(Z)` for values near zero and `-` for zero. We need to replace these before converting to numbers. `str_replace_all()` swaps text patterns, and `parse_number()` converts text like `"910,000"` into the number `910000`:

```{r}

```
The columns are now numeric! 

## Step 4: Filter to 2024 and Select Columns

We use `filter()` to keep only 2024 rows, `select()` to drop columns we don't need, and `case_when()` to create readable quarter labels:

```{r}


  mutate(quarter_label = case_when(
    quarter == "Q1_2024" ~ "Jan–Mar",
    quarter == "Q2_2024" ~ "Apr–Jun",
    quarter == "Q3_2024" ~ "Jul–Sep",
    quarter == "Q4_2024" ~ "Oct–Dec"
  )) |>

```


## Step 5: Pivot Stressor Data to Long Format

The stressor data has one column per stressor type — this is called **wide format**. For plotting, we need **long format**: one row per observation. `pivot_longer()` reshapes it:

```{r}

```

Our 6 stressor columns became two: `stressor` and `pct_affected`. Each row is now a single observation — this is **tidy data**.


## Data Visualization 

`ggplot2` builds plots in layers: data, geometry (what to draw), and labels.

The basic template looks like this:

```r
ggplot(data = data, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_type()
```

Let's build a visualization step by step.

## Plot 1: National Average by Stressor

First, let's summarize the data to get the **national average** percentage affected by each stressor across all states and quarters:

```{r}

```

Now let's plot it as a bar chart. We use `reorder()` to sort bars from highest to lowest:

```{r}

```



# Workshop Review

Let's recap what we covered today:

- **Importing** raw CSV data with `read_csv()`
- **Renaming** columns to `snake_case` with `rename()`
- **Standardizing** text with `str_to_title()` and `mutate()`
- **Replacing** USDA placeholder codes and converting to numeric with `str_replace_all()` and `parse_number()`
- **Filtering** and **selecting** rows and columns with `filter()` and `select()`
- **Reshaping** from wide to long format with `pivot_longer()`
- **Summarizing** grouped data with `group_by()` and `summarise()`
- **Visualizing** data with `ggplot2` using bar charts

The Tidyverse is a toolkit — each function does one thing well, and the pipe `|>` lets you chain them into readable, reproducible workflows. The more you practice this pattern, the more natural it becomes.
